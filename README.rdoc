Allows users to post anonymous comments. 

Originally all comments would need to be approved by an admin. Devsise invitable was used so that admin accounts could only be created through an email invitation. 

Users wanted posts to be unfiltered, so posts are now displayed automatically. Users now have the ability to monitor the posts themselves, with up and downvotes as well as the power to remove anything really bad.
